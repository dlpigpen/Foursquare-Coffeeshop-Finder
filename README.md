Foursquare CF Finder
---------------
Foursquare CF Finder is a sample iOS app which uses the [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to find coffee-shops near the user and show them on a map.

Purpose
--------------

I have been working on this project recently as part of an application process for a iOS Enginee vacancy. The mockup has been created by myself, it is very familar with the iPhone user. 

The assignment was:

Create a simple, native iOS application to find coffee shops near your location. This application should meet the following minimum requirements: 

● Use the Foursquare API (or a different API of the candidates choosing) to gather information about nearby coffee shops

● Show a map with pin overlays representing the coffee shop locations 

● Selecting a pin should show a brief description of the coffee shop 

● The user should have a way to see more details about the coffee shop Above are the minimum requirements that the application should have. Ideally you will include additional features of your choosing.

The whole process has taken me approximately 12 hours. This involved designing icons, fixing bugs and cleaning up the code. This task was taken very seriously and I have done my best to take the project as far as I can. 

I hope you like it and I look forward to hearing any feedback.
